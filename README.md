# Fundamental of programming python in ArcGIS (ArcPy)
In this repository, you can find the course data, course goals, and codes.

## Topics
- Importing shapefiles
- Defenition query on layers
- Selecting by location
- Using loop through a list
- Reading data from layers table
- Using loop on tables
- Reading shapefiles from a folder
- Projection
- Loop through some shapefiles
- Editing layers table
## Data
We have 2 shapefile as our problem input data that you can find here. After extracting zip files you will find 2 shapefile representing cities and countries across the earth. Both downloaded from the natural earth data site.
## Project goals
### First, we want to split cities of every country to a layer, this means we want 255 shapefiles that each contain cities of a specific country.

### Second we are going to project these 255 shapefiles to another spatial reference

### And at last we are going to edit a layer table via ArcPy
## Codes
You can find codes here. codes are split step by step for better understanding.
Also, there is another folder that reminds the basic concept of python programming.
